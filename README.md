# Recommendations to Reduce Toil In Ticketing System

Below are my recommendations for possible solutions to the issue's our engineering team is facing as the result of toil coming from our current alerting and ticketing system.

## Off-the-Shelf Products

There are a number of paid and self-hosted services that can help manage toil generated by the unsophisticated alert ticketing system.

Because of our small size, it would benefit us most to go with an off-the-shelf solution that best fits our current and near-future (~2 yrs) needs in order to keep operational expenditures to a minimum, yet still address the growing needs for a more robust system that is currently in place.

Some possible candidates for solutions to help us manage a ticketing system, in addition to identifying, prioritizing, scheduling, and implementing automations across our product landscape are:

- Shoreline
- LogRocket
- Dynatrace
- PagerDuty
- Microsoft System Center
- LogicMonitor
- Datadog
- New Relic
- AppDynamics

## Roll Our Own

While it is not recommended, we always have the ability to roll our own solutions to these issues, but again, because we are a small team, this is not generally a feasible approach and would take significant and important effort away from feature work. It is almost certainly cost-prohibitive.

## Other Quick Remediation Techniques

We needn't wait for the implementation of either of the above options before we take steps to deal with some of the more toilsome tasks that arise from our alerting system.

We all know which issues are the source of constant interruptions throughout the week, and thus it is worth pulling one or two engineers familiar with those systems onto an automation project for a few days to at minimum, identify possible automation solutions to stop the bleeding, and at best, implement those solutions.
